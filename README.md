# Music Generation using C-RNN-GAN in PyTorch

## Status
* As far as implementation of the C-RNN-GAN architecture is concerned, code is already finished. I have yet to train a generator that can output some pleasant MIDI though :sweat_smile:. I'll upload the model and the generated MIDI once done.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch
* [python3-midi](https://github.com/louisabraham/python3-midi)
